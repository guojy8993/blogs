OpenStack Networking (neutron) manages all of the networking facets for the Virtual Networking Infrastructure (VNI) and the access layer 
aspects of the Physical Networking Infrastructure (PNI) in your OpenStack environment. OpenStack Networking allows tenants to create 
advanced virtual network topologies including services such as firewalls, load balancers, and virtual private networks (VPNs).

Networking provides the following object abstractions: networks, subnets, and routers. Each has functionality that mimics its physical 
counterpart: networks contain subnets, and routers route traffic between different subnet and networks.

Any given Networking set up has at least one external network. This network, unlike the other networks, is not merely a virtually defined
network. Instead, it represents the view into a slice of the external network that is accessible outside the OpenStack installation. IP 
addresses on the Networking external network are accessible by anybody physically on the outside network. Because this network merely 
represents a slice of the outside network, DHCP is disabled on this network.

In addition to external networks, any Networking set up has one or more internal networks. These software-defined networks connect directly
to the VMs. Only the VMs on any given internal network, or those on subnets connected through interfaces to a similar router, can access 
VMs connected to that network directly.

For the outside network to access VMs, and vice versa, routers between the networks are needed. Each router has one gateway that is 
connected to a network and many interfaces that are connected to subnets. Like a physical router, subnets can access machines on other 
subnets that are connected to the same router, and machines can access the outside network through the gateway for the router.

Additionally, you can allocate IP addresses on external networks to ports on the internal network. Whenever something is connected to a 
subnet, that connection is called a port. You can associate external network IP addresses with ports to VMs. This way, entities on the 
outside network can access VMs.

Networking also supports security groups. Security groups enable administrators to define firewall rules in groups. A VM can belong to 
one or more security groups, and Networking applies the rules in those security groups to block or unblock ports, port ranges, or traffic
types for that VM.

Each plug-in that Networking uses has its own concepts. While not vital to operating Networking, understanding these concepts can help you
set up Networking. All Networking installations use a core plug-in and a security group plug-in (or just the No-Op security group plug-in).
Additionally, Firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS) and Load-balancing-as-a-service (LBaaS) plug-ins are available.
